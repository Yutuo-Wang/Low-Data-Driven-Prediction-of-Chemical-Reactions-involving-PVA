This is the official repository for the paper entitled PVA-ReAct: <u>Low-Data-Driven Prediction of Chemical Reactions involving PVA: A Quantum Chemistry-inspired Multiscale Deep Learning</u>. This work employs a revolutionary model that mimics the bonding changes that occur during a reaction and can be used to predict the outcome of reactions involving PVA with a high degree of accuracy using a relatively small training set, with no need for pre-training or additional functionality. Materials scientists and chemists will benefit from the model's strong generalization ability, which not only allows it to effectively predict reactions involving PVA, but also extends its application to the modeling and analysis of chemical reactions in other material systems, providing a universal solution for the intelligent optimization of different chemical systems.

Files related to the model are in this repository.
